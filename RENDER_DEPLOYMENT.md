# Deploying the Pilot Test Run on Render

This gets you a live, shareable instance with **1 cooperative, 1 employee (Field
Officer), 1 Cooperative Manager**, plus a Director account, and open self-signup
so testers can create their own accounts with any email address.

## 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
cd embu-coop-system
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Pilot deployment scaffold"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-org>/embu-coop-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. Deploy the Blueprint

1. In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), click **New +** → **Blueprint**.
2. Connect the GitHub repo you just pushed.
3. Render detects `render.yaml` at the repo root and proposes three resources:
   - `embu-coop-db` — free PostgreSQL instance
   - `embu-coop-backend` — Node/Express API
   - `embu-coop-frontend` — Next.js app
4. Click **Apply**. First deploy takes ~5–10 minutes (installs deps, then
   `npx prisma db push` creates the tables directly from `schema.prisma`).

> **Why `db push` and not `migrate deploy`?** This repo doesn't have a
> `prisma/migrations/` folder — generating one requires running
> `prisma migrate dev` against a real database once, which wasn't possible
> in the environment this scaffold was built in. `db push` syncs the schema
> straight to the database with no migration history, which is the right
> tool for a pilot. Before treating this as a long-lived production system,
> run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` against a real dev database once
> to generate proper migration files, commit them, and switch the build
> command back to `migrate deploy` for safer, reviewable schema changes.

## 3. Fix the cross-service URLs

Render assigns each service a URL like `https://embu-coop-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`
(the `xxxx` suffix only appears if the plain name was taken). After the first
deploy:

1. Copy the **actual** backend URL from its Render page.
2. On `embu-coop-frontend` → **Environment**, set
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to `https://<actual-backend-url>/api`.
3. Copy the **actual** frontend URL.
4. On `embu-coop-backend` → **Environment**, set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` to the
   actual frontend URL (needed for CORS).
5. Both services will auto-redeploy after the env var change.

## 4. Seed the pilot accounts

On `embu-coop-backend` → **Shell** tab, run:

```bash
node prisma/seed-pilot.js
```

This creates (all share the password `Pilot2026!` — change on first login if
you add a password-change flow, or just rotate the seed password before a
wider pilot):

| Role | Email | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Director | `director@embu.go.ke` | Admin oversight, staff management, document/committee approvals |
| Field Officer (employee) | `employee@embu.go.ke` | Plans visits, submits reports, uploads documents |
| Cooperative Manager | `manager@embu.go.ke` | Manages the one seeded cooperative's members/documents/committee |

Cooperative seeded: **Kirimiri Coffee Growers Cooperative Society** (`EMB-PILOT-0001`).

### Already deployed and hit `P2021: table does not exist`?

That means the build ran before this fix (with `migrate deploy` and no
migration files). Run this once in the Shell tab to create the tables, then
seed as normal:

```bash
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
node prisma/seed-pilot.js
```

## 5. Open self-signup for other testers

`ALLOW_OPEN_SIGNUP=true` is already set in `render.yaml` for this pilot. Anyone
with the frontend URL can go to `/signup` and register as a Field Officer or
Cooperative Manager with **any email address** — no domain restriction, no
admin approval. This is intentional for a fast test run.

**Before this goes anywhere near real County data:** set `ALLOW_OPEN_SIGNUP`
back to `false` in the backend's environment variables. Open signup with no
email verification is fine for a two-week pilot with disposable test data; it
is not an access-control model for production.

## 6. Known limitations of this pilot build

- **Free-tier Render services spin down after 15 minutes idle** and take
  ~30–60 seconds to wake on the next request — expect a slow first load
  after inactivity. Fine for a pilot; upgrade to a paid plan before a real
  demo day.
- **Free Postgres on Render expires after 30 days.** Export/back up data
  before then, or upgrade the database plan.
- **Document uploads are stubbed** — the DMS approval workflow (pending →
  reviewed → approved) is fully functional, but it doesn't yet accept a real
  PDF file; it records a placeholder storage key. Real file upload to object
  storage is a follow-on task, not required to test the approval workflow
  itself.
- **No password reset / email verification** — expected for a pilot; needed
  before production.
